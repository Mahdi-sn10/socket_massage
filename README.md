# Socket Communication

This project consists of a simple socket application that allows two terminals to communicate with each other. One terminal acts as a server, while the other acts as a client. Messages can be sent back and forth once the connection is established.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## File Structure

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone
Run the Socket Server

Open a terminal window and run the server code:
python socket.py
The server will start and wait for a client connection.
Run the Socket Client

Open another terminal window and run the client code:
python socket_cli.py
Once the client is connected to the server, you can start sending messages. Type your message in the client terminal and hit Enter to send it to the server.
